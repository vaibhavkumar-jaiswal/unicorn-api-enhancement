# unicorn

* it takes some time until a unicorn is produced, the request is blocked on requesters site and he need to wait 

* to improve the situation adjust the code, so that the requester is receiving a request-id, with this request-id he can poll and validate if unicorns are produced

* if the unicorn is produced it should be returned though using fifo principle

* adjust the code, so that every x seconds a new unicorn is produced at put to a store, which can be used to fulfill the requests (LIFO Store)

* make sure, duplicate capabilities are not added to the unicorn

* improve the overall code

* if any requirements are not clear, compile meaningful assumptions
